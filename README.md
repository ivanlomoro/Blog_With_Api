# Blog with API

This is a simple blog application that fetches and displays posts from the JSONPlaceholder API. Users can view, edit, and delete posts, as well as load comments for each post.

## Features

- Display a list of posts with titles and images.
- Load more posts as the user scrolls.
- View detailed information about a post, including title, body, author details, and comments.
- Edit a post's title and body.
- Delete a post.
- Load comments for a post.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap)
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Usage

1. The main page displays a list of posts.
2. Click on a post to view its details.
3. On the post details page, you can edit the post title and body by clicking the "Edit" button.
4. To delete a post, click the "Delete" button.
5. To load comments for a post, click the "Load comments" button.
6. To load more posts, click the "Load more" button at the bottom of the page.

## API

The application fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API. The API base URL is `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`.

## Simulating Data Editing and Deletion

To simulate editing and deletion of data, you can use `json-server` to serve the data located in the `./data/db.json` file. To do this:

1. Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the command: `json-server .\data\db.json`

This will start `json-server` and use the data from the `db.json` file as the API source. Now, edits and deletions will be simulated using this local server.
